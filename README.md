# Mines Game

This is a simple minesweeper-like game developed with HTML, CSS, and TypeScript. Players can choose the number of mines to be placed in a 5x5 grid and click on tiles to try and avoid mines. If a player clicks on a tile with a mine, they lose the game. If all non-mine tiles are clicked, the player wins.

## Features

- Select the number of mines to place on the grid.
- Click on tiles to uncover them. The game ends when a mine is clicked.
- Tiles are dynamically created, and the game state is managed using JavaScript.
